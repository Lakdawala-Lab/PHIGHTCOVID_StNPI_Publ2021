            When the process occurred:  2002-01-31T00:00:00
            Description: The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted and generalized the features from ArcUSA 1:25M. Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) by splitting the United States into-if present: Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands-and the 48 contiguous states (including District of Columbia); converting each to NAD83; then merging them together. Created ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr). Created projection file (.prj). Ran ArcView GIS Avenue™ request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.

        Process step:

            When the process occurred:  2002-10-10T00:00:00
            Description: The following steps were performed by Esri: Copied the Molokai coastline from U.S. Counties (Generalized). Created ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.

        Process step:

            When the process occurred:  2012-02-07T00:00:00
            Description: The following steps were performed by Esri: Copied Data & Maps 10 U.S. States (Generalized) and renamed it. Removed all fields but STATE_NAME. Attached and formatted the fields from Data & Maps 2012 U.S. States. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS® layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.

        Process step:

            When the process occurred:  2013-03-28T00:00:00
            Description: The following steps were performed by Esri: Deleted the fields POP2000 and POP00_SQMI. Added the field POP2012 and added and calculated the field POP12_SQMI. Converted the data set to SDC.

        Process step:

            When the process occurred:  2014-08-20T00:00:00
            Description: The following steps were performed by Esri: Deleted the fields POP2012 and POP12_SQMI. Added the field POP2013 and added and calculated the field POP13_SQMI. Replaced the fields NO_FARMS07, AVG_SIZE07, CROP_ACR07, and AVG_SALE07 with the fields NO_FARMS12, AVE_SIZE12, CROP_ACR12, and AVE_SALE12 from the 2012 Census of Agriculture. Put "-99" values into these fields for records where there were no matches. Converted the dataset into a file geodatabase.

        Process step:

            When the process occurred:  2015-08-24T00:00:00
            Description: The following steps were performed by Esri: Deleted the fields POP2013 and POP13_SQMI. Added the field POPULATION (alias POP2014) and added and calculated the field POP_SQMI (alias POP14_SQMI). Placed them just after the STATE_ABBR field so that all the 2010 Census fields are together. Put "-99" values into these fields for records where there were no matches.

        Process step:

            When the process occurred:  2016-08-10T00:00:00
            Description: The following steps were performed by Esri: Deleted the fields POP2014 and POP14_SQMI. Added the field POPULATION (alias POP2015) and added and calculated the field POP_SQMI (alias POP15_SQMI). Put "-99" values into these fields for records where there were no matches.

    Data quality report - Conceptual consistency:

        Measure description: The dataset is converted to file geodatabase (FGDB) format using tools in ArcGIS. The geometry is checked, and if needed repaired.

    Data quality report - Completeness omission:

        Measure description: After processing, the dataset is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.

    Data quality report - Absolute external positional accuracy:

        Measure description: The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the ArcUSA 1:25M database, and then generalized. Generalizing reduces positional accuracy and the tolerance was not recorded so the positional accuracy exceeds that of the ArcUSA data set. The positional accuracy of the ArcUSA 1:25M data set is 1792 meters which is based on generalizing–to a tolerance of 500 meters–the 1:2,000,000-scale USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG) source data.
