Raw data from COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. 

Data acquired on github from COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

The Lakdawala Lab at the University of Pittsburgh restructured the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data acquired from github and produced the number of new daily cases and deaths as well as the cumulative cases and deaths in a format which fit our project needs. We also added geographical coordinates as well as 2017 U.S. population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.
