The scoring criteria was created to satisfy the restriction conditions of most states to the best of our ability, please reach out if a more in-depth discussion is desired.

*note: only when a category is 100% lifted will the score be 0.00. The scoring is designed so that unless there is an action to lift the original order, a small score will remain in place. For example even if all non-essential business conditions have been eased the score will still be 0.05, not 0.00.								
*note: when a category is lifted, the score will be the difference between it's pre-lifted score and 0.00 (the category equaling 0.00, not the entire score equaling 0.00)								
Action Types:								
Closing								
Restricting								
Easing								
Lifting
